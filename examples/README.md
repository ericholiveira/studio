Examples
========

The exampleActors folder contains all the actors used by the examples, as you will see
the actors implementation is independent of the drivers.

The hello-* folders contains drivers for some web development frameworks, you can
pick anyone and start your study.

To run the examples, you can navigate to the hello-* folder and execute "node index.js"
or you can navigate to project's root folder and execute "grunt example:* "
(where * is the name of the web development framerwork, i.e "grunt example:express")

Check the drivers and actors source code for comments explaining what is happening
